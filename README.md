# pyfit

A fitting program aims to fit IXS (inelastic X-ray scattering) spectra (phonon - to be more precised).

====================

+ INSTALLATION

Linux & Windows:

 - Install Python 2.7 (I prefer to use Anaconda 64 bits)
 - Install PyQt4 (Anaconda comes with PyQt5 by default, please downgrade it: conda install pyqt=4)
 - Other requirements (normally these will be automatically installed when you install pyfit): numpy >= 1.11, scipy >= 0.19, lmfit >= 0.9.5, matplotlib >= 1.5 and PyMca5.
 - Download and extract the source code of pyfit. Go to the folder where setup.py is found, open a terminal (command prompt on Windows) and type:
python setup.py install (on Linux you might need to use *sudo* permission)

===========

+ RUN

 - To run it: On both Linux and Windows, a shortcut is created on your Desktop, double click it to run this program. Otherwise you can open a terminal (command prompt) and type *pyfit*.
